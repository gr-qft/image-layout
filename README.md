### Comments

- Since the goal is to achieve a responsive layout from the mockup, I've focused on using HTML and CSS and not on creating React components.
- In a real work environment, I would communicate with the designers to clarify what is wanted precisely for the UI in between the two screen sizes. Here I aim for a simple solution where there is one column for Iphone 8 size, a centered column for all sizes up until the desktop size.

- In a real work environment, I would also
  ask about the margin, padding, other measurements, and image assets. Moreover, I would more likely create some utility classes and use them instead of using selectors excessively.

- The demo is tested with browser developer tool as well as with a real Iphone X, an Ipad, and a desktop monitor. I've added extra CSS so that the layout look correct for all these cases.
